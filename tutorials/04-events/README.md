# Events

In the browser, we want to be able to respond to user actions. These actions are called _events_. In this section, we'll discuss how to listen for events and run code when an event occurs. We'll also discuss how to emit our own custom events.

Basic outline

* Add an event listener to a DOM element
* Discuss event bubbling
* Introduce jQuery
* Experiment: Three boxes
* Storing data in the `data-` attribute
* Writing your own custom events
