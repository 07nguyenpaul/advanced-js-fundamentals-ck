# Events

In the browser, we want to be able to respond to user actions. These actions are called _events_. In this section, we'll discuss how to listen for events and run code when an event occurs. We'll also discuss how to emit our own custom events.

In this section, we'll cover

* [The basics of listening for and responding to events in the browser](01-basic-events.md)
* [Event bubbling](02-event-bubbing.md)
* [Adding and removing event listeners](03-adding-and-removing.md)
* [Responding to specific key events](04-keycodes.md)
* [Storing data in `data-` attributes](05-data-attributes.md)
* [Event delegation](06-event-delegation.md)
